# BUGS

1. Bug: When you enter a valid 4 letter ICAO code and click add airport, the modal remains in place with the value entered.
Fix: After the object newAirport has been successfully passed to the function storeNewAirport I included two functions. The first function clears the input value and the second function hides the modal.

2. Bug: If the user doesnt enter a valid ICAO code and selects Add Airport a warning message appears. If the user subsequently decides to close the modal and then decides to open the modal again, the warning message is still in place.
Fix:
